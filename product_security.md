To reduce application security issues in a DevOps pipeline, product security engineers implement a combination of proactive and reactive strategies. Below is an itemized list of best practices and processes:

### **1. Shift-Left Security**  
- Integrate security early in the development lifecycle (requirements, design, coding).  
- Use automated security tools in CI/CD pipelines to catch issues before deployment.  

### **2. Threat Modeling**  
- Conduct threat modeling during design/planning phases to identify risks (e.g., STRIDE, PASTA).  
- Define mitigation strategies for identified threats.  

### **3. Secure Coding Guidelines**  
- Enforce secure coding standards (e.g., OWASP Top 10, CWE/SANS Top 25).  
- Use linters, code formatters, and pre-commit hooks to block insecure patterns.  

### **4. Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**  
- Integrate SAST tools (e.g., SonarQube, Checkmarx) to analyze code for vulnerabilities during builds.  
- Fail pipelines on critical findings.  

### **5. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**  
- Run DAST tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite) in staging environments to detect runtime flaws (e.g., SQLi, XSS).  

### **6. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security**  
- Scan IaC templates (Terraform, CloudFormation) for misconfigurations using tools like Checkov or Terrascan.  
- Enforce least-privilege policies for cloud resources.  

### **7. Dependency Management**  
- Use Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools (e.g., Snyk, Dependency-Check) to identify vulnerable third-party libraries.  
- Automate updates via Dependabot or Renovate.  

### **8. Secrets Management**  
- Avoid hardcoding secrets; use tools like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.  
- Scan repositories for accidental secret exposure (e.g., GitGuardian, TruffleHog).  

### **9. Secure CI/CD Pipeline Configuration**  
- Restrict pipeline permissions using role-based access control (RBAC).  
- Sign artifacts and verify integrity (e.g., cosign, Notary).  

### **10. Container Security**  
- Scan container images for vulnerabilities (e.g., Trivy, Clair).  
- Enforce minimal base images and non-root user execution.  

### **11. Compliance as Code**  
- Define compliance policies as code (e.g., Open Policy Agent) for automated enforcement.  
- Audit configurations against standards like CIS Benchmarks.  

### **12. Security Training & Awareness**  
- Train developers on secure coding, threat detection, and incident response.  
- Gamify learning with CTF challenges or phishing simulations.  

### **13. Penetration Testing & Red Teaming**  
- Conduct regular manual penetration tests and simulated attacks.  
- Address findings via prioritized remediation.  

### **14. Runtime Protection**  
- Deploy RASP (e.g., Contrast Security) and Web Application Firewalls (WAFs).  
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity (e.g., failed login attempts).  

### **15. Incident Response Planning**  
- Maintain a playbook for security incidents (containment, eradication, recovery).  
- Conduct periodic drills to test response readiness.  

### **16. Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)**  
- Generate SBOMs (e.g., SPDX, CycloneDX) to track dependencies and expedite vulnerability response.  

### **17. Peer Code Reviews**  
- Mandate security-focused code reviews with checklists for common vulnerabilities.  

### **18. Patch Management**  
- Automate patching for OS, libraries, and frameworks.  
- Validate patches in staging before production rollout.  

### **19. Threat Intelligence Integration**  
- Subscribe to vulnerability feeds (e.g., CVE, NVD) and automate alerts.  

### **20. Post-Incident Retrospectives**  
- Perform root-cause analysis (RCA) and update processes to prevent recurrence.  

### **Key Outcomes**  
- Reduced mean time to detect (MTTD) and remediate (MTTR) vulnerabilities.  
- Compliance with standards (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS).  
- Cultivation of a security-first culture across DevOps teams.  

By embedding these practices into the pipeline, organizations minimize security debt and align with DevSecOps principles of continuous security validation.
